# SomeInfo 


First of all, i am not professional in DS, i have just entered this field, i took some courses on it in Python, Descriptive statistic , and some courses when i was in the college.

Moreover, in this file i applied some Data Analysis technques on certain data i have took it from IBM during Online Course, tichiques such as DealingWithMissingValues, Data standardization, Data Normlization, Binning , Indicator variable .

i uploaded this file in order to share what i learned with you guys as well as learn from you.

so let me explain some concepts related to data analysis before we start.


Data Wrangling has several diffrent names, it can be defined as the process of converting data from the initial format to a format that may be better for analysis.


all techniques mentioned above located under this concept (Data Wrangling) .


** Dealing with Missing Values, by follwoing these steps : 1. Identify Missing value 2. then dealing with it weather by replace the data or drop it .

** Data standardization, as you know tha data we are going to analyze comes form various sources with diffrent format, this may cause some issue when we analyze the data, in order to solve this issue we convert this data into common format .

** Data Normlization can be defined as the process of transforming values of several variables into a similar range.


** Binning is a process of transforming continuous numerical variables into discrete categorical 'bins', for grouped analysis.


** An indicator variable (or dummy variable) is a numerical variable used to label categories. They are called 'dummies' because the numbers themselves don't have inherent meaning.
